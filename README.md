This project was created for the DataCan takehome assignment and is a currency converter
The project allows the user to deposite currency of different exchanges into their account
This program is written in C# and .NET using Windows Forms Applications
At this time tehre is no error checking or form validation, however these are features I plan on adding. Adding more accounts and users is also a future feature that can be added.
